// Currently, no global types are strictly needed beyond component props,
// which are co-located. If shared complex types arise, they can be added here.

// Example:
// export interface UserProfile {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   email: string;
// }
export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module
